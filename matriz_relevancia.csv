But now I'm unable to even scan for wifi networks and of course connect to any network.

In the attached logs, which I gathered using adb, there are some hints.

What you did:
* Wipe data: y
* Upgrade from previous official cm build: n
* Restore with titanium backup: y, a long time ago and no problems occured
You're using (if yes write which one) :
*no mods
Bug info:
* I donÂ´t know if the problem occured on older versions but I think it didnt. That is the reason why I can't tell when it worked last time.
* Repro steps:
I was using the Fritz!TV app to listen to radio that is transmitted over DVB-C and sent by my Fritz!Box 6590 Cable to my device via wifi. Suddenly the wifi connection stopped even though I was not far away from the router (~10:34:45). Then I waited a bit and it reconnected at ~10:35:20.
I have not changed any advanced options for my wifi (Schippers-EG-C). 
The problem is very annoying because it happens very often and sometimes the device does not even reconnect to the wifi. Also IZ facing this problem with many other wifi routers. 
Thank you very much!",1,0,,,,
3,REGRESSION-1530,Wifi issue,"I noticed the problem with the wifi does not really depend on the revision of the latest firmware.
The wifi module is disabled without the ability to enable on any revision of firmware under version 14.1, after turning off the phone, for one reason or another.
The problem can not be solved if the phone is restarted, in this case the full restoration of the factory settings or firmware reflashing helps.
But if the phone is turned off then the probability of repeating this problem is high. I checked most of the firmware versions on the smartphone *Nexus 6p (Angler)* and constantly encountered this problem.

23,BUGBASH-1341,Weak wifi signal,"Hi,
The wifi signal is *very* weak on lineageOS, which renders the wifi nearly unusable: The phone never reports full signal strength, even at 10 cm of the router, and the wiki connection drops if I'm, like, 5m away from the router.
This is definitely a software issue, because I don't have the issue on the stock firmware.
What I tried so far:
 * different radios: no change, as expected
 * clean install of the last 4 versions of LineageOS ,with and without Gapps: no change
 * reinstall stock firmware (full wipe): no issue on stock firmware
Some investigations:
 * the wpa supplicatant conf is slightly different on stock firmware (wpa_supplicant.conf, wpa_supplicant_overlay.conf and p2p_supplicant_overlay.conf)
 * there seems to be a lot more firmware files on stock (in etc/wifi, not vendor/firmware):

What you did:
 * Clean flash: 
You're using (if yes write which one) :
 * AdAway
 * Repro steps
Since a few days a got random wifi shutdowns for no reason. I made a clean flash of lineageos with different versions. First the Lineageos 14.1 build of matssa with extra commits from xda. I had the errror there, too.
Then I switched with a clean flash to the offcial nightly from the 25nd and had the same error again. I tested a few apps if they harm the wifi but they hadn't an effect. just left it like it was flashed and got the wifi shutdown, too.
As you might see in the alogcat file there are two errors which might cause the wifi disconnect. E/netd (2480): netlink response contains error
E/WifiHal (3196): wifi_get_packet_filter_capabilities: requestResponse() error: -524 I will upload a few logcats where the bug happend, so that you guys can see whats the reason for that. I did the logcat with ROOTalogcat on the phone. I'm using the phone normally and randomly the wifi crashes and reconnects again. At beginning I was using system profiles to change into wifi when i come home. Due to the error it kicked me out of my home profile all the time because it disconnected ramdomly from the wifi and I used this as a trigger. All other devices in the wifi are working normal. Another phone doesn't have problems with the wifi either.",0,0,,,,

Steps to replicate. Hide ssid. Allow wifi to turn of during sleep. Wait for a day or 2. Any other combination and the problem does not happen.

and IZ sorry to not specify a last known good build cause I tested all your builds and they all have the same problem the wifi keep connecting and disconnecting for some reason .. you can only notice the problem while playing games I could find this problem in 13.1 CM as well the only version of android that doesn't have it is the lollipop ...
I search the whole internet for a solution without any help I find some points effect the problem hope they might help solving it
1 Skype does make it happen more often 
2 Airplane-mode ( for some reason when switching the phone to Airplane-mode the problem appears less than usual
3 activating blue tooth does help the problem appears less than usual as well
last thing to say ... the problem happen even with a clean installation of Lineage os using the main browser for some time making a file download over the wife make it happen and it happen like this 
the wifi connected ( you see the wifi icon on the upper right near the mobile signal )
suddenly the wifi icon disappears that is when you know that the wifi is dropped 
wifi icon reappears thats when you know it reconnected
I thought at first it is a router problem so I changed three routers and yet the problem is still there no matter what router I use or what wifi speed or band they all drops

42,REGRESSION-111,WiFi connection crashes framework,"This is *probably* the same as REGRESSION-90 and REGRESSION-106; it seems to be an issue affecting multiple devices in the latest nightly.
Upon initial boot, if WiFi is on, the framework crashes and soft restarts (presumably as WiFi attempts to connect). After this, the phone has trouble scanning WiFi networks, but eventually something happens to trigger another framework crash and restart, every few minutes (presumably it eventually decides to try to reconnect). Disabling WiFi fixes the repeated restarts. Booting with WiFi off and then enabling WiFi causes a reboot within a few seconds.
The attached logcat was taken by rebooting with WiFi off, waiting for things to settle a bit, and then enabling WiFi; it covers the period from the state toggle to the crash. I censored out saved SSIDs and BSSIDs for privacy, but please let me know if you need more.

 I'm not sure if this is a LineageOS related typo, or Google related typo, since I decompiled the Google Dialer app and coresponding service APKs and couldn't find the string there. Maybe this is a typo in LineageOS (klte model).
The issue can be found in the *lineage-14.1-20170510-nightly-klte-signed.zip* as well as in the *lineage-14.1-20170517-nightly-klte-signed.zip* build.

yesterday I was a witness at a heavy accident in germany an I had to dial the ""110"" (that is the equivalent of the emergency-call-no 911 in the USA).
Lineageos hadn't start the call. Instead of this it change the window and hang up for a short time.
Fortunaley I wasn't alone and I could use the phone of a friend with. He had the same phone with the normal android software.
I can't tell you, if the emergency-call-no. 110 in germany have ever worked in the past versions of linageos, because I haven't need this no. before.

When entering Call settings/GSM call settings the header reads 'GSM call settings', which is correct. However, when entering Call settings/CDMA call settings the header reads '{color:#ff0000}Additional{color} CDMA call settings'. To have a consistency here, the word 'Additional' should be removed, so that it just reads: '{color:#14892c}CDMA call settings{color}'.
I've attached 3 screenshots to show the inconsistency.
Ignore the last good build in this Jira ticket above, as Jira requested a last known good build.
Would be happy to see this fixed in a upcoming build/nightly build.
Is there a way to change from Medium Priority to Minor or similar? Haven't found it yet.

 # Hang up the phone call and check the status bar
 # Get a call and answer it
 # Check that on the status bar the icon associated to mute / vibrate is on
 # Turn off the ringtone of your phone (either on mute or on vibrate)
 * Expected result
 # Nothing changes in the ringtone settings
 * Observed results
 # As soon as the phone call is hung up, the ringtone is back on.
This issue may lead to some inconvenience, especially when the phone is utilized in an quiet environment when ringtones are not supposed to be on.
