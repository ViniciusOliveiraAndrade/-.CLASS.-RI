Suddenly the wifi connection stopped even though I was not far away from the router (~10:34:45).

I made a clean flash of lineageos with different versions. First the Lineageos 14.1 build of matssa with extra commits from xda. I had the errror there, too.\n\nThen I switched with a clean flash to the offcial nightly from the 25nd and had the same error again. I tested a few apps if they harm the wifi but they hadn't an effect. just left it like it was flashed and got the wifi shutdown, too.\n\nAs you might see in the alogcat file there are two errors which might cause the wifi disconnect.\n\nE/netd (2480): netlink response contains error\n\nE/WifiHal (3196): wifi_get_packet_filter_capabilities: requestResponse() error: -524\n\nI will upload a few logcats where the bug happend, so that you guys can see whats the reason for that.\n\nI did the logcat with ROOTalogcat on the phone. I'm using the phone normally and randomly the wifi crashes and reconnects again.\n\nAt beginning I was using system profiles to change into wifi when i come home. Due to the error it kicked me out of my home profile all the time because it disconnected ramdomly from the wifi and I used this as a trigger.\n\nAll other devices in the wifi are working normal. Another phone doesn't have problems with the wifi either.",

To have a consistency here, the word 'Additional' should be removed, so that it just reads: '{color:#14892c}CDMA call settings{color}'.\nI've attached 3 screenshots to show the inconsistency.\nIgnore the last good build in this Jira ticket above, as Jira requested a last known good build.\nWould be happy to see this fixed in a upcoming build/nightly build.\n\nIs there a way to change from Medium Priority to Minor or similar?
